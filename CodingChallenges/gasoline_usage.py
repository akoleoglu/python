# Write a program that will prompt the user for inputting a floating point number that stands for gallons of gasoline. 
# You will re-print that value along with other information about gasoline and gasoline usage:
# Amount of liters
# Amount of barrels of oil required to make this amount of gasoline
# Price in US dollars
# Input
# ------------------------------
# Enter a number which stands for gallons of gasoline: 15

# Output
# ------
# 15.0 gallon(s) = 56.781 liter(s).

# 0.7692307692307693 barrel(s) of oil required to produce 15.0 gallon(s) of gas

# It will cost 42.58575 dollar(s).
